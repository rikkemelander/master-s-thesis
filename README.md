# master-s-thesis

This project is used to create the plots in the thesis 'Analysing the effect of extrapolation on feature importance measures'.
To get equivalent plots it is enough to run main.py.
It is also possible to run each function in the files seperately as long as the data is created before the corresponding plots.
The data is created in following order:
1. Make sure that the directories 'plots' and 'data' exist.
2. Run all functions in data_simulation.py
3. Run the functions of measure_improvement.py and influence_calculating.py
